[MUSIC]. 
Last time, we talked about data types, 

2
00:00:07,565 --> 00:00:11,469
dimensions and how to map data to visual 
attribute based on the number of data 

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:15,812
dimensions. 
Clearly there's a large design space for 

4
00:00:15,812 --> 00:00:19,704
this visual encoding. 
Information visualization is about 

5
00:00:19,704 --> 00:00:24,150
choosing the most effective visual 
encoding for a given data set. 

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:32,750
In this lecture, we're going to describe 
how to do that. 

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,484
We saw earlier that there are different 
data types. 

8
00:00:35,484 --> 00:00:38,143
And those can be mapped to a set of 
visual attributes. 

9
00:00:38,143 --> 00:00:41,786
And some mapping are better than others. 
So now we have a challenge. 

10
00:00:41,786 --> 00:00:45,632
How do we pick the best mapping of all 
possibilities? 

11
00:00:45,632 --> 00:00:50,030
So in order to do this we're going to 
follow three basic principles. 

12
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,097
Importance ordering, expressiveness and 
consistency. 

13
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:58,681
This was first described by Jock McKinley 
in 1986. 

14
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:02,748
So importance ordering has to do with 
encoding the most important information 

15
00:01:02,748 --> 00:01:07,477
in a most perceptually active way. 
Expressiveness has to do with depicting 

16
00:01:07,477 --> 00:01:12,690
all the data and only the data. 
And finally consistency means the 

17
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,480
property of the image, the visual 
attributes should match the properties of 

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,530
the data. 
I'll go into more detail on how to do 

19
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:26,540
this on the following slides. 
We'll start with importance ordering. 

20
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:31,320
We've seen this slide before. 
Now as we discussed earlier, decades of 

21
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,930
research have taught us that certain 
visual attributes more accurately 

22
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,498
represent quantitative data to the human 
brain. 

23
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:46,990
Mackinlay defined expressiveness in the 
following manner: he said a set of facts 

24
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:51,120
is expressible in a visual language if 
the sentences: i.e the visualizations in 

25
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,110
the language express all the facts in the 
set of data and only the facts in the 

26
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,430
data. 
So what does this mean? 

27
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,240
Well, using color hue we cannot express 
the fact that one item is greater than 

28
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,688
another. 
So color hue simply can't represent 

29
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:11,080
ordinal data. 
Ordinal or quantitative data. 

30
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,470
So color hues simply can't represent 
ordinal or quantitative data. 

31
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:28,390
It's best you use phenomenal data. 
On the other hand you don't want to 

32
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,590
express facts that are not in the data. 
So a length is interpreted as a 

33
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,130
quantitative value. 
In this incorrect use of a bar chart, the 

34
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,200
length of the bars say something untrue 
about the data. 

35
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:47,930
So on the x axis we have the national 
origin of these cars, now on the y axis 

36
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,250
the make and model. 
Now the length of the bars suggests an 

37
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:57,360
ordering on the axis. 
So it implies that somehow Germany is 

38
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,480
greater than the USA. 
So therefore using bars for nominal data 

39
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:11,165
is an incorrect choice. 
Number three, we have consistency. 

40
00:03:11,165 --> 00:03:15,920
The properties of the image, the visual 
attributes should match the properties of 

41
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,930
the data. 
What this means, is you don't want to do 

42
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,110
something like mapping one dimensional 
data to two or three dimensional visual 

43
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,530
representations. 
This diagram represents why that is not a 

44
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,990
good idea. 
So here we have the price per barrel of 

45
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:36,070
oil represented as the height of a three 
dimensional barrel. 

46
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,710
You can see the obvious problem here. 
Look at 1974. 

47
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:50,180
The price is $10.95 and then for 1979, 
the price is $13.34. 

48
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:56,620
Well this is less than a 30% increase. 
And yet the 1979 barrel looks 

49
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,346
significantly larger than the 1974 
barrel. 

50
00:04:00,346 --> 00:04:03,408
So clearly this is an inconsistent 
representation. 

51
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:08,320
The three-dimensional representation is 
implying something false about the 

52
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,100
underlying data. 
Let's move to a data encoding exercise. 

53
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,430
Here we have a data set of cars. 
We have the model on the first column. 

54
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:24,906
The country of origin, the year, the 
number of cylinders, the horsepower, the 

55
00:04:24,906 --> 00:04:28,640
miles per gallon and finally the weight 
in pounds. 

56
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,210
I would like you to create a 
visualization that encodes all seven 

57
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,820
dimensions in this data set. 
Make the perceptually appropriate choices 

58
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,750
and be prepared to explain. 
I will describe the steps you need to do 

59
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,940
and show you Bertin's examples once more. 
So step one the terminal which columns 

60
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,287
represents nominal, ordinal or quantative 
data. 

61
00:04:51,287 --> 00:04:56,720
Step two review the transvisual 
attributes on the next slide and assign 

62
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,115
the most perceptually appropriate choices 
to each data set. 

63
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:05,500
Step three create a visualization that 
encodes as many of the seven dimensions 

64
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,140
as you can. 
Don't worry if you can't get all of them 

65
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:13,407
but, but do try to do so. 
To review here are Bertin's visual 

66
00:05:13,407 --> 00:05:21,430
attributes. 
Position, size, value, texture, color, 

67
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,650
orientation and shape. 
Are you done? 

68
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,770
Here's one attempt made by one of my 
students. 

69
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,210
So this is an attempt at encoding seven 
variables from the cars dataset in a 

70
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:41,260
single visualization. 
So this student chose to put two of the 

71
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,545
quantitative variables, horsepower and 
miles per gallon on the x and y axis. 

72
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:52,240
The third ratio data weight he encoded 
with area of the marks. 

73
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,419
Not a bad choice since you, you can only 
put two of those ratio variables on axes. 

74
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,440
He also chose to encode cylinders, which 
are quantitative integral data by using 

75
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,210
the shape of the mark. 
And then finally he used color hue for 

76
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:16,240
the region, Europe, Japan or US. 
And color value or lightness for the 

77
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,740
year. 
Additionally in his visualization you can 

78
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:26,020
mouse over each of the marks and the name 
of the model of the car would pop-up. 

79
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,895
So, what do you think of this 
visualization? 

80
00:06:28,895 --> 00:06:34,190
What works, what doesn't and what could 
you do better? 

81
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,740
I'll leave that critique as an exercise 
for you.
