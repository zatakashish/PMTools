In this lecture we're going to talk about 
the heart of information visualization, 
data types and visual mappings. 
So, the central problem in order to 
visualize data is, is quite simple, we 
need to map data sets to visual 
attributes. 
This is also known as data encoding. 
And the process can be described in a 
very straightforward manner. 
One, you classify your data types, and 
two, you determine which visual 
attributes represent data types most 
effectively. 
Of course the devil is in the details. 
Let's start with data types, there are 
three basic data types, nominal, ordinal, 
and quantitative, which can be further 
subdivided into interval and ratio. 
I'm going to explain each of these on the 
next slide. 
So, nominal data can be thought of labels 
or names, an example is fruit. 
Apples, oranges, peaches, pears will be 
described as nominal data. 
Ordinal data has an order associated with 
it. 
So, for example, the quality of meat 
might be described as grade A, grade 
double A, grade triple A. 
There is an implicit order. 
So, you can clearly say that grade triple 
A is better than grade double A. 
The two types of quantitative data. 
Interval data is where the location of 
zero is arbitrary. 
So, dates are an example. 
If you're looking at January 5, 2012 or 
location for example. 
Latitude 47, longitude 122 and these are 
like a geometric point. 
You can't compare them directly, but only 
differences, that is, intervals, can be 
compared. 
And then finally you have ratio data, 
which is where the zero is fixed. 
And you can think of this as any physical 
measurement, length, mass, counts and 
amounts. 
The origin is meaningful. 
Let's talk a little bit more about the 
differences between nominal, ordinal, and 
quantitative data. 
Sometimes it's not immediately clear 
given an example, what data type that it 
falls into. 
So, one of the best ways to actually 
identify data as nominal, ordinal, or 
quantitative, is to look at what are the 
operations that are permitted on this 
data. 
So nominal data, there really only two 
operations that are permitted, either 
equals or not equals. 
For example with fruit, you can say that 
oranges are not equal to apples, and 
apples are equal to apples. 
There's no other comparison that can be 
made. 
You can't say that oranges are somehow 
better than apple. 
Ordinal data has additional operations 
besides equals and not equals. 
You can now say that one is greater than 
or less than another. 
Or greater than or equal to, or less than 
or equal to. 
So, for example with the, the grades of 
meat that we [INAUDIBLE], you can see 
that that triple A is better than double 
A, and vice versa. 
Greater than, less than. 
You can deal with that implicit ordering. 
Now moving to quantitative data with 
interval data, for example, dates. 
Now you can subtract. 
So you can measure distances or spans. 
You can say that not only is January 6, 
2012 after January 5, 2012, but you can 
say the difference between those two 
dates is one day. 
And finally, coming to ratio data, where 
the zero is fixed, now you can add 
division or ratios. 
You can measure ratios or proportions. 
So, for example, if an object weighs 32 
grams, you can say that it weighs twice 
as much as another object that weighs 16 
grams. 
Alright, so that's the theory, now let's 
put it into practice with an exercise. 
I'm going to show you a spreadsheet and 
I'd like you to think about which of the 
columns in the spreadsheet are nominal, 
ordinal or quantitative. 
So, here we have a set of sepal and petal 
lengths and widths for three species of 
iris. 
The first column, you have an id number, 
then a case number. 
Next, a species number, then a species 
name, the organ, petal or sepal, the 
width and length of that organ in 
millimeters. 
So, why don't you take some time and 
think about which of these are nominal, 
ordinal and quantitative. 
You can see that its not as straight 
forward as it might appear in the first 
place, for example we have numbers here 
that fall into the categories nominal, 
ordinal and quantitative. 
So, let's explain why each of these is 
defined the way it is. 
So, the quantitative is probably the 
easiest. 
The orange data, the width and the length 
of the sepal and petal are quantitative. 
You can say for example, that for the 
first species the length is seven times 
the width. 
So, you can perform ratios and 
proportions. 
So it's quantitative data. 
Now the first two, the ID number and the 
case number are ordinal. 
So why are they not quantitative? 
Well, because it's really not something 
where you can say the distance between 
the ID number three and the ID number two 
has any meaning. 
But it clearly has an order. 
The ID numbers were assigned in some 
particular order. 
So, therefore it's ordinal. 
And the cases were assigned in a 
particular order, but there's not 
necessarily a meaning for the differences 
between them. 
So ID and the case numbers are ordinal. 
Now we have the species number, the 
species and the organ, which are nominal. 
Well, it's probably pretty clear that the 
species name, and the organ would be 
nominal, because there names. 
All you can do, is say whether they're 
equal or not equal to each other. 
You can't say that the sepal is somehow 
greater than the petal. 
So that, those are pretty easy. 
But what about the species number? 
Why isn't that ordinal? 
And the answer to that is simply because 
in this case, the species number is 
simply a label. 
There is no order to it. 
It was assigned to the species simply as 
a labeling convention. 
Alright, so hopefully that has been a 
useful example for you. 
Alright. 
So, moving on, we've now completed step 
one of the process of information 
visualization. 
So, now let's describe how to do step 
two, mapping data types to visual 
attributes. 
In 1967, Jacques Bertin, a French 
cartographer made the first formalization 
of visual language and the first attempt 
at a theoretical foundation for 
information visulaization. 
He identified seven key visual 
attributes, illustrated on the right hand 
side of the page in zero, one, and two 
dimensions. 
And these seven key attributes are 
position, size, value or lightness, 
texture, color, orientation, and shape. 
So, this is an important slide. 
You should probably write down these 
seven, these seven attributes or at least 
save this slide. 
So, now that we have taxonomies of both 
data types and visual attributes, let's 
talk about how we map one to the other. 
So, Bertin offered the following 
suggestions. 
He said there were levels of organization 
that you could consider. 
Position can be used for nominal, ordinal 
[LAUGH] or quantitative data as can size. 
Now value or lightness can be used for 
nominal or ordinal data and perhaps for 
quantitative data although it's not quite 
as clear. 
And texture can be used for nominal data, 
maybe for ordinal data. 
You could imagine a denser texture might 
be seen as having some order over a, a 
lighter a, a less dense texture. 
And then finally color, orientation, and 
shape can really only be used for nominal 
data. 
You can't really say that one color is 
greater than another, or that one 
orientation is less than another, or that 
a, a, a shape, a star, say, is me, is 
more than or less than a circle. 
And further work that involves decades of 
research in psychology and psychophysics, 
have established this hierarchy of 
perceptual properties. 
Humans can detect differences in position 
most accurately, then length, then angle 
on slope, then area, then volume. 
And least of all color and density. 
So, when you're assigning these 
attributes to your data. 
Make sure to choose position for your 
most important quantitative data. 
And save color and density for nominal 
data. 
A final note on color. 
Value can be perceived as ordered, so you 
can encode ordinal variables. 
In other words, you see this strip that 
goes from black to white, where value is 
increasing, you can see that there is an 
order to these colors. 
You can also even encode continuous 
values with a gray scale mapping, 
although not as well. 
The hue is normally perceived as 
un-ordered. 
So, you always only want to encode 
nominal variables using color. 
The is no order to the colors on the 
bottom of the slide. 
So, this was a very brief lecture on the 
central important problem of information 
visualization. 
In the next lecture, we'll look at 
exercises where you can actually put this 
theory into practice.
