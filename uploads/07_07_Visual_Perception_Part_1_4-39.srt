00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:07,461
[MUSIC]. 
In the previous lectures, we've been 

2
00:00:07,461 --> 00:00:11,903
discussing data and visual mappings. 
Now we're going to talk about the other 

3
00:00:11,903 --> 00:00:15,456
end of the pipe line. 
How that information is processed by 

4
00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:19,939
human brain. 
This is the first of three lectures on 

5
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:25,706
visual perception. 
70% of our body's sense receptors reside 

6
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:29,063
in our eyes. 
Our very language resonates with the 

7
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:32,780
importance of our eyes. 
Metaphors to describe understanding often 

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,780
refer to vision. 
I see, insight or illumination. 

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,090
Colin Ware stated in 2004. 
They eye and the visual cortex of the 

10
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:45,500
brain form a massively parallel processor 
that provides the highest bandwidth 

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,710
channel into human cognitive centers. 
In these three lectures we're going to 

12
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,350
describe how it's important to understand 
how visual perception works in order to 

13
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,960
effectively design visualization. 
The first key principle to keep in mind 

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,169
is that the eye is not a camera. 
A better metaphor for vision was given by 

15
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:10,210
Christopher Healey in 1995. 
It's a dynamic and on going construction 

16
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,060
project. 
It's important to keep this in mind as 

17
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,720
you go thru the next three lectures. 
Because when you go design a 

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,100
visualization, if you think of the eye as 
a camera, it can lead you to some eno, 

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,460
erroneous conclusions. 
Attention is selective. 

20
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,710
We, we all know that. 
it's filtered to a high degree. 

21
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,500
And it's really cognitive processes that 
transform the visual information into 

22
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,980
something that we can comprehend. 
The field of psychophysics is concerned 

23
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,010
with establishing quantitative 
relationships between physical 

24
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,130
stimulation and perceptual events. 
So we're going to be talking about some 

25
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,045
of the important discoveries made in this 
field in the next three lectures. 

26
00:01:49,045 --> 00:01:54,750
Let's think a little bit about how to use 
perceptual properties. 

27
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,170
Information visualization should cause 
what is meaningful to stand out. 

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:07,270
So what do you see in this image. 
Can you see the 2 spots that differ from 

29
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,670
their surroundings? 
Why do you see them? 

30
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,340
We're going to answer that question in 
the next few slides and lectures. 

31
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,700
Some important differences between eyes 
and cameras. 

32
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:23,420
Cameras have very good optics. 
They have a single focus, they maintain a 

33
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,500
white balance and a single exposure. 
And they also do what's known as a full 

34
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,600
image capture. 
In another words, all the photons coming 

35
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,440
into the eye are captured with equal 
importance and at the same time. 

36
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,220
The eyes on the other hand have 
relatively poor optics. 

37
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,830
They're constantly scanning. 
This is known as saccades, the shifting 

38
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,230
of your eyes to various positions There 
constantly adjusting focus, there 

39
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,890
constantly adapting, both the white 
balance and the exposure. 

40
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:56,030
What's really going on is mental 
reconstruction of the image, sort of, as 

41
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,720
we'll find out it's not even a complete 
image thats reconstructed. 

42
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,110
So here's one example. 
Visual perception really isn't just 

43
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,610
camera work. 
Looking at this checker board it's pretty 

44
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,310
clear that square A is darker than square 
B, right? 

45
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:24,840
Turns out if you gray out the image, you 
see the truth. 

46
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,710
Square A and square B have identical 
pixel values. 

47
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,850
As a matter of fact when I first saw this 
image I didn't believe it. 

48
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,430
I actually put the image in Photoshop and 
used the Eyedropper tool in order to find 

49
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,270
out what the RGB values were of those two 
squares. 

50
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:44,520
And yes indeed they are identical. 
So you're welcome to do the same you can 

51
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,290
take a screen capture and test it out 
yourself. 

52
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,080
But it's pretty interesting. 
The human visual system is so dependent 

53
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,590
on context and upon reconstructing the 
image that we see these two squares, 

54
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:03,560
which are identical as quite different. 
Color is relative as are many other of 

55
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,760
our perceptions. 
If you look at this slide, doesn't it 

56
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,710
look like the x on the left hand side is 
gray and the one on the right hand side 

57
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,180
is yellow? 
But if you go look at were they connect 

58
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,600
at the center bottom of the slide you'll 
see that they're identical. 

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,430
And that's again because the eye 
perceives differences. 

60
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:28,030
It does not perceive actual pixel values. 
So in conclusion I hope you've taken away 

61
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,269
from this lecture that the eye is not a 
camera. 

62
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:34,610
In the next 2 lectures, we're going to 
discuss more about how understanding how 

63
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,421
the visual perception can help us develop 
more effective visualizations
